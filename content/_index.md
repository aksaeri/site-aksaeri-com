        I lead the **AI Risk Index** at **MIT FutureTech** and **The University of Queensland**, building the evidence base that decision-makers need to manage high-priority AI risks.
        
        I also help grow Australia's AI safety ecosystem through policy collaborations, community building in Melbourne, and national convenings.

        **Two streams of work:**

        1) **AI Risk Index (MIT FutureTech × UQ)** — research leadership, collaboration, and delivery to assess which AI risks matter most, which mitigations work, and how key actors are responding.

        2) **Australia's AI safety ecosystem** — collaborating with **Good Ancestors Policy**, convening the **Melbourne AI Safety** community, designing and facilitating the **2024 AI Safety Forum**, and maintaining **AISafety.org.au**.

      title: "AI Risk Index"
      text: |
        The **MIT AI Risk Initiative** reviews and communicates evidence on AI risks and mitigations. The **AI Risk Index** turns this into a continuously updated public resource to help people and institutions understand risks, identify effective mitigations, and track organizational responses over time.

        **Current activities include** a [systematic review of AI risk mitigations](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/669550d38372f33552d2516e/6887e58496902e3bcad04a5a_Mapping%20AI%20Risk%20Mitigations.pdf), expert **Delphi studies**, and a **review of organizational risk responses** (for public benchmarking in the Index).

        **My role:** program strategy and execution — research design, multi-institution collaboration, methods & tooling (systematic reviews, Delphi), data infrastructure, and communications.

        **Research questions (guide the Index):**
        1. What are the risks from AI, which are most important, and what are the critical gaps in response?  
        2. **What are the mitigations for AI risks**, and which are the highest priority to implement?  
        3. **Which AI risks and mitigations are relevant to which actors and sectors?**  
        4. **Which mitigations are being implemented, and which are neglected?**  
        5. **How is the above changing over time?**

        

        ### What we've built on
        The **AI Risk Repository** (living systematic review of AI risks) distils 60+ frameworks and has significant reach (135k+ visits), wide referencing (650+ sites incl. Amazon, IBM, Trend Micro), citation in the **International AI Safety Report 2025**, and integration with the **AI Incident Database**.
