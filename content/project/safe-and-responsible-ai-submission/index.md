title: Safe and Responsible AI submission
date: 2023-09-16T07:22:40.380Z
summary: Working with Good Ancestors Policy, I supported three streams of work
  to respond to a consultation by the Australian government about safe and
  responsible AI. This work included (1) contributing to a [detailed submission
  from Good Ancestors
  Policy](https://www.goodancestors.org.au/s/Publications-2023-DISR-submission-safe-and-responsible-AI.pdf)
  to the consultation, (2) organising and delivering community workshops to help
  interested people write their own submissions, and (3) coordinating a
  [co-signed statement and open
  letter](https://www.australiansforaisafety.com.au/) from Australian AI
  experts.
