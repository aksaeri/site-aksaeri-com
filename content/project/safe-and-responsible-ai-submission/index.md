date: 2023-09-16T07:22:40.380Z
summary: |-
  Working with Good Ancestors Policy, I supported three streams of work  to respond to a consultation by the Australian government about safe and responsible AI. This work included:
  
  1. Contributing to a [detailed submission from Good Ancestors Policy](https://www.goodancestors.org.au/s/Publications-2023-DISR-submission-safe-and-responsible-AI.pdf) to the consultation, 
  2. Organising and delivering community workshops to help interested people write their own submissions, and 
  3. Coordinating a [co-signed statement and open letter](https://www.australiansforaisafety.com.au/) from Australian AI experts.
