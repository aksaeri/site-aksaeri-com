title: Scale up toolkit
date: 2023-09-16T05:58:52.754Z
summary: "When we know that a behaviour change intervention has worked in a
  pilot or trial, how can we scale it up to achieve greater impact and reach?


  I led this work at BehaviourWorks in collaboration with the Victorian
  government Behavioural Insights Unit to develop an evidence-informed toolkit
  to help behavioural insights researchers and practitioners improve the scale
  up of their behaviour change interventions.


  \r

  - Learn about scale up, its challenges, and useful frameworks\r

  - Identify which behaviour to target with an intervention\r

  - Assess the feasibility of different intervention ideas\r

  - Select a scalable behaviour change intervention

  - Design or adapt an intervention for testing and scale up

  - Test scale up assumptions about your intervention in a pilot or trial"
