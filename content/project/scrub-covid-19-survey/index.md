title: SCRUB COVID-19 survey
date: 2023-09-16T07:06:00.672Z
summary: |-
  The SCRUB COVID-19 survey aimed to provide current and future policy
  makers with actionable insights into public attitudes and behaviours relating
  to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
  I led this project, which was incubated at Ready
  Research, funded initially by Monash University, and then funded and conducted
  collaboratively with the Victorian Government. 
  
  Over 2020-2021 we conducted 21  waves of the survey, about 1 every 3 weeks, and collected rich behavioural and
  attitudinal data from more than 40,000 people.
