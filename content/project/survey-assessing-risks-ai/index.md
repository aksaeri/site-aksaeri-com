summary: |-
  With Michael Noetel and other collaborators at The University of Queensland, I'm conducting a Survey Assessing Risks from AI (SARA) in Australia. 
  
  There is a gap in good quality data on public perspectives on AI risks and governance, especially in Australia. This information is crucial for making informed policy and governance decisions for current and future, more capable and more general AI systems. 

  We'll conduct an online survey of 1,000 Australian adults.
