  - We designed and delivered online facilitator training to engaged EAs in
  Australia and New Zealand. Participants included community leaders and staff
  at EA organisations. 

  - The training course covered key elements of facilitation, including asking questions, active listening, planning and preparation, reading the room, and managing participants. 

  - We conducted an evaluation of the course, which found that participants were very confident the course was very helpful for their facilitation practice, and identified the practical exercises with rapid reflection and feedback as key components that made the course valuable for them. 

  - We believe that facilitation training, implemented effectively, could assist community building in Effective Altruism by improving learning, group discussions, and successful events.
